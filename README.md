# SWC Intro Python Addition


One of the main differences between SWC's [Intro R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/) and Intro Python courses is that the for loop in the fourth module doesn't include outputting the plots to the directory system. The code below does this.

This course extra is building on the Software Carpentry course, [Programming with Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/).
